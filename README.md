* 5-6pm: Resolving nivo Dependancy, adding more depandacies for project.
Example project did not use react 17.0 therfore there are dependancy issues with using NIVO because I'd have to learn a different version of react 17.0 in order to code, causing a lot of issues. Deciding on wether or not to continue using NIVO or use a different library for charts.

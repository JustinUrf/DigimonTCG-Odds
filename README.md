### Friday, 05/05/23
* 8-9am Resolving some bugs, reviewing old projects for guide.
* 5-6pm Resolving nivo Dependancy, adding more depandacies for project.
Example project did not use react 17.0 therfore there are dependancy issues with using NIVO because I'd have to learn a different version of react 17.0 in order to code, causing a lot of issues. Deciding on wether or not to continue using NIVO or use a different library for charts.
* 6-7PM Reading Plotly documentation and being sad that NIVO doesn't work in 18.0.0
* 7-8PM Testing Plotly in seperate file to see if it works WIP.

### Name of Student: Justin Lee

### Name of Project: What are the odds? 

### Project's Purpose or Goal: The purpose of this project is to visualize the odds of things happen so that players in a specific trading card game can gain better insight of how the cards they put into a deck affect the odds of things happening over a large sample of games.

### List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

* Players can insert a deck to their specified ratio of cards for a specific trading card game including "monsters" from levels 3-7, "options", "combo pieces" etc. 
* Players can visualize what an opening hands looks like, the amount of times there are starters or rather cards you want to see in your opening hand of 5, the total amount of each card in their hand with the chances displayed i.e "With this deck, there is a 90% chance there are at least 1 card, or 52% chance that there are two of these cards in your starting hand etc, etc.
* Players can see more specific or harder to visualize stats for example about how many cards on average will it take to see a combination of 5-6 cards (combo cards).
* Hosted on Netilify or some other hosting service.
* Stylized and easy to follow user experience.

### What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

* React
* JavaScript
* HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
* Nivo (React Graphing API)

### If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

* More really specific scenarios of things happening based off deck.
* Work with another card database API that allows players to see/import their decks with visauls for them.
* Generating the opening hands with API above once imported.
* Allow users to save and store decks.

### What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

* Digimoncard.Dev API

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?

* Project made as a brother who played Trading Card Games proffessionally and always wondered what the "Best" way to build/make a deck was.
